# Task Manager

This is a basic task manager that will manage user's tasks.
It will perform CRUD operations like `create`, `edit`, `list`, and `delete`.

| functions | operations                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `create`  | creates a new task           |
| `edit`    | edits an existing task by ID |
| `list`    | lists all tasks              |
| `delete`  | delete a task by ID          |
