# Task Manager

This is a basic task manager that will manage user's tasks.
It will perform CRUD operations like `create`, `edit`, `list`, and `delete`.

| functions | operations                  |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `create`  | this creates a new task     |
| `edit`    | this edits an existing task |
